    "response": "Hey there! Good start with the `Sum` function idea.\n\nLet's make a small adjustment to make it work perfectly and be super clear.\n\n---\n\n### Code Review: `Sum` Function\n\n**Problem Found:**\n\nRight now, your `Sum` function tries to add `a` and `b`, but it doesn't know what `a` and `b` are. They aren't defined inside the function, so it can't find them when it tries to do the math.\n\n**Simple Solution:**\n\nTo fix this, you should pass `a` and `b` into the function as 'arguments'. This makes your function much clearer about what it needs to work.\n\n**Here's how you can change it:**\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) { // We're passing 'a' and 'b' into the function\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n**How it works:**\n\nNow, when you want to use your function, you just tell it what numbers to add:\n\n```javascript\nlet result = sum(5, 3); // Here, 'a' will be 5 and 'b' will be 3\nconsole.log(result);   // This will print 8\n```\n\nThis way, the function always knows exactly which numbers to sum up!\n\n**Small Suggestion (Good Practice):**\n\nIn JavaScript, it's a common practice to start function names with a **lowercase** letter (like `sum` instead of `Sum`). It just makes your code a bit more consistent with standard styles. I've used `sum` in the example above."
